### **Project Objective** 

The project goals and objectives were inspired by SMART goal theory that was developed by Doran, Miller, and Cunningham.

Specific, Measurable, Agreed-upon/Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound

**Primary Goals:**

- Project will allow the user to maintain their inventory efficiently.

- Project will allow the user to maintain a profit over the inventory.

**Objectives:** 

- To maintain inventory by having a baseline stored-inventory-threshold and tracking the number of items sold and added to inventory.

- To control the inventory size by updating the total inventory every time an item is sold or added to it.

- To organize the inventory by allowing users to group and search an item alphabetically or based on category, date, popularity, or by the object id when the user requests it.

- To have at least a 10% profit margin by tracking the category, popularity, cost, or title of the items sold versus un-sold.

- To maintain the customers base by being up-to-date on popular items, promoting customer feedback, and offering discounts on unpopular or hard-to-sell items.


### **Team Collaboration and Documentation Tools**
- **Coordination:** We chose Practica as our primary platform of communication. It offers a structured environment to discuss our projects development.
- **project environment:** We will be using GitHub throughout our project, for efficient version control and collaberation.

- **Scheduled Meetings:** We plan on utilizing the Microsoft teams platform to schedule our virtual meetings that are organized by the project manager
### **Project Managment Plan and Methodologies**

Our primarily approach for the project will be to use Agile and Scrum methodologies. The project will be broken up into smaller sizes know as "sprints" to align with Agile and Scrum.
